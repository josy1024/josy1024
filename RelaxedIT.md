# Relaxed IT 

The concept of relaxedIT revolves around **empowering** users with a toolset that allows them to control and manage IT systems, rather than being controlled by them. 
It emphasizes **self-repairing systems** and **automation** scripts that can check the status of services and perform necessary repairs without constant human intervention.

In essence, relaxedIT aims to create a more **user-friendly** and autonomous IT environment, where the tools are designed to **simplify** management tasks and reduce the need for manual oversight.
